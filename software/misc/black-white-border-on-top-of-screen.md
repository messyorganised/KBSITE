# Black / White Border on top of Screen

[**Issue**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

Black border at the top or bottom row of your screen. This issue creates a 'hollow' strip on your screen which can cause user experience issues on your daily tasks.



**Cause**

As far as I'm aware, the issue is caused due to a graphics driver glitch.&#x20;



**Solution**

\
_Temporary_

A graphics driver refresh should resolve this issue. Though the current method is only temporary and permanent solution is yet to be found.
